Daily digest of finance YouTubers and X accounts: Gemini watches the videos, extracts structured stock calls, aggregates consensus, and emails you.

Once a day it collects the new videos and posts from the accounts you follow and has Gemini watch each video straight from its YouTube link. It counts who is bullish or bearish on each ticker, writes up where the bloggers agree and disagree, and emails you the result. An optional section covers your own holdings: prices, technical indicators, news, and what the bloggers said about them.

**Language.** The digest and the prompts are in Simplified Chinese, because the digest is written for Chinese readers. The channels can be in any language: the example config follows 10 Chinese and 6 English YouTube channels and 1 English X account.

## What you get

This is the top of [`docs/sample-digest.md`](docs/sample-digest.md), the output of `finfluencer-digest --demo`. In demo mode the channels, posts and model replies are made up; only the tickers are real.

The full digest goes on with the tickers on your watchlist (你关注的股票), a table of bullish, bearish and neutral calls per ticker (个股提及统计), the key points of each video or X account (各博主要点), and a last line with the day's Gemini calls and tokens. It arrives as an HTML email with the Markdown as the plain-text part, and a copy is saved to `digests/`.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    feeds["YouTube channel RSS<br/>(YouTube Data API as fallback)"] --> findnew
    xposts["X accounts<br/>(FxTwitter API)"] --> findnew
    findnew["Find new items<br/>inside the lookback window, not seen before, no Shorts"] --> watchv
    findnew --> readx
    watchv["Gemini watches each video from its URL<br/>3 at a time, model fallback chain"] --> summ
    readx["Gemini reads each account's new posts"] --> summ
    summ["Structured JSON per video or account<br/>one-liner, key points, stock calls, facts, risks"] --> tally
    summ --> synth
    tally["Aggregate<br/>bullish / bearish / neutral per ticker"] --> renderd
    synth["Synthesize<br/>consensus, disagreements, claims to check"] --> renderd
    portf["Portfolio section<br/>(optional)"] -.-> renderd
    renderd["Render the Markdown digest"] --> mail["Email via Gmail<br/>HTML + plain text"]
    renderd --> archive[("digests/YYYY-MM-DD.md")]
    tally --> callslog[("data/calls.jsonl")]
```

Real runs and the demo share one pipeline, `run_digest` in `cli.py`. After the email is sent, the IDs of processed videos and posts go to `state/seen.json` (kept for 60 days) so nothing is summarized twice, and the day's calls are appended to `data/calls.jsonl`. A video that fails is not marked as processed, so the next run retries it while it is still inside the lookback window (36 hours in the example config). `--demo` runs the same pipeline with the network and Gemini replaced by files shipped in the package: RSS feeds, an X API reply and recorded model responses.

## Design decisions

### Gemini watches the video itself

Nothing is downloaded or transcribed. The YouTube URL goes to Gemini as `file_data.file_uri`, and Gemini watches and listens on its own. To keep that cheap, it samples 0.2 frames per second (`video_fps`) at low media resolution (`media_resolution`) and stops after the first 50 minutes of each video (`max_minutes`); finance videos are mostly talk, and this was measured at about 38 tokens per second of video. The costs: reading YouTube links is still a preview feature that Google may change or start charging for, only public videos work, and the free tier covers about 8 hours of video a day.

### Models fall back in order

During a run, every Gemini request goes through `Gemini.generate` in `llm.py`, which tries a list of models in order. In the example config, videos use gemini-3.8-flash → gemini-3.5-flash → gemini-3.5-flash-lite, and the synthesis, X posts and portfolio analysis use `synth_models`, which lists the same three (with billing on, gemini-3.1-pro-preview can go first). Each model gets up to 3 attempts: errors that are usually temporary (no HTTP status code, or 500, 502, 503, 504) are retried after 30 and then 60 seconds (30 × 2^i), while any other error, such as 429 (quota or rate limit), moves on to the next model at once. If every model fails, the video or X account is listed as failed at the end of the digest and retried on the next run. The usage line at the bottom of each digest shows calls and tokens for the models that actually answered.

### Scheduled runs pass a gate first

GitHub's free scheduler can start a run late or drop it when it is busy, so one fixed trigger time is not reliable. The deployment template ([`deploy/daily-digest.yml`](deploy/daily-digest.yml)) wakes up every 30 minutes from 07:10 to 10:40 UTC, and a gate job runs `finfluencer-digest gate` (`gate.py`) before anything else. The gate lets the run through only after 08:00 UK time, and only if today's `digests/YYYY-MM-DD.md` does not exist yet. The run commits that file back to the repository, so later checks that day stop at the gate, and a dropped check is simply caught up by the next one. The result is at most one email a day (one exception is listed under [Limitations](#limitations)); manual runs skip the gate.

### News bullets must cite a source the program fetched

This applies to the optional portfolio section. Gemini sorts each holding's news from the last 7 days into good-news and bad-news bullets, and the output schema asks for every bullet to end with its date and source, such as (09-22 Reuters). `cited_only` in `portfolio/section.py` keeps a bullet only if that source matches a news item the program actually fetched from Longbridge, Finnhub, Google News or Yahoo Finance. That drops bullets where the model passed off a technical indicator as news or made up a source; if nothing is left, the card lists the fetched headlines instead. Gemini only sees public data here, such as tickers, prices, indicators, analyst targets, news and the bloggers' views, never your quantities, costs or amounts.

### Every call is logged for scoring later

Each blogger's view on each ticker is appended to `data/calls.jsonl`, one JSON line per call: date, channel, video ID, ticker, name, stance (看多 / 看空 / 中性, that is bullish / bearish / neutral) and the one-sentence reason (`call_rows` in `aggregate.py`, `save_calls` in `state.py`). Lines are written only after the email has gone out, never in dry runs or the demo. The point is to score the bloggers later: set against the price moves that followed, the file gives each blogger's real hit rate (see [Roadmap](#roadmap)). The portfolio section already reads the past week of it back to show what bloggers said about each of your holdings.

## Numbers

| What | Number |
|---|---|
| Sources | 16 YouTube channels (10 Chinese, 6 English) |
| One real run over all 16 channels (22 September 2026) | 16 videos (15 about markets, 1 skipped as off-topic), 17 Gemini calls including the synthesis |
| Gemini usage in that run | gemini-3.5-flash: 12 calls, about 590k input and 38k output tokens<br>gemini-3.5-flash-lite: 5 calls, about 216k input and 3k output tokens |
| Cost | $0, within Gemini's free tier |
| A typical day (estimate) | about 12 new videos; the run takes about 15 minutes, 3 videos at a time |
| Demo mode | no network, finishes in under 1 second |

## Run it

Needs Python 3.12 or later. The package is not on PyPI yet, so install it from GitHub and run the demo:

```bash
pip install "finfluencer-digest @ git+https://github.com/jackyyangjq/finfluencer-digest"
finfluencer-digest --demo
```

Or run it once with uv, without a permanent install:

```bash
uv tool run --from "git+https://github.com/jackyyangjq/finfluencer-digest" finfluencer-digest --demo
```

The demo runs the whole pipeline on made-up channels, posts and recorded model replies: no config, keys, network or email. It prints the digest and saves it to `demo-output/2026-09-23.md` (`--out DIR` picks another folder).

For real use you need a Gemini API key (the free tier is enough) and a Gmail account with an app password. Three steps, in a folder of your own:

```bash
# 1. Config and keys: edit the channel list in config.yaml; fill in GEMINI_API_KEY, GMAIL_ADDRESS
#    and GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD in .env (the file says where to get each one)
curl -fsSLo config.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackyyangjq/finfluencer-digest/main/config.example.yaml
curl -fsSLo .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackyyangjq/finfluencer-digest/main/.env.example

# 2. Check the Gemini key and every configured model, the Gmail login, each channel and X account
finfluencer-digest --check

# 3. One video end to end: the digest is saved to digests/, nothing is emailed or marked as processed
finfluencer-digest --limit 1 --dry-run
```

After that, `finfluencer-digest` does a real run; the digest goes to `GMAIL_ADDRESS` unless you set `EMAIL_TO`. Keys can also come from environment variables instead of `.env`. `--config PATH` points to a config elsewhere, and `state/`, `data/` and `digests/` are always written next to the config file. To add a channel, `finfluencer-digest --find-channel @handle` prints its ID. The portfolio section is off by default. It needs the extra (`pip install "finfluencer-digest[portfolio] @ git+https://github.com/jackyyangjq/finfluencer-digest"`), `portfolio.enabled: true` in `config.yaml` and a holdings file; see [the portfolio part of the deployment guide](deploy/README.md#portfolio-section-optional).

## Deploy

It is built to run on GitHub Actions' free scheduler, with nothing left running on your own machine. A private repository of yours holds `config.yaml` (and holdings files, if you use the portfolio section), your keys go into Actions secrets, and each run installs a pinned release of this package and commits the digest and run records back. [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md) walks through the setup, and [`deploy/daily-digest.yml`](deploy/daily-digest.yml) is the workflow to copy.

## Limitations

- Gemini's free tier handles about 8 hours of YouTube video a day. Reading YouTube links directly is still a preview feature, and Google may change the rules or start charging.
- Only public videos work. Members-only videos end up in the list of failures at the end of the digest.
- YouTube channel RSS feeds sometimes fail for cloud servers. If the digest keeps reporting 视频列表获取失败 ("could not fetch the video list"), get a YouTube Data API key and set it as `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`; the program then falls back to the API on its own.
- X accounts are read through the free FxTwitter API, which is unofficial and may stop working. Failures are listed at the end of the digest and do not affect the rest.
- The 08:00 cut-off and the digest date follow UK time (Europe/London), fixed in `config.py` for now.
- One exception to one email a day: if there are new videos and every one of them fails, the run still emails the digest, then exits with an error so that GitHub notifies you. The template then skips saving the archive, so each later check that morning runs again and can send another email.
- The digest only collects what the bloggers said. It is not investment advice.

## Tests

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jackyyangjq/finfluencer-digest && cd finfluencer-digest
pip install -e ".[dev,portfolio]"
ruff check . && pytest -q
```

The tests never touch the network and need no keys. Gemini is replaced by a stub or by recorded replies, the feeds and the clock are passed in, and nothing actually sleeps. They cover the per-ticker tally, feed parsing and video filtering, rendering, the fallback and retry rules, the state files, the gate, the news source check, the technical indicators, and the full demo run with network access blocked, including a check that `docs/sample-digest.md` still matches the demo output. Without the `[portfolio]` extra, the portfolio tests are skipped. CI runs ruff, the tests and the demo on every push to main and every pull request.

## Roadmap

- **Filings Q&A research agent** (October–November 2026): answers questions about companies from their SEC filings, with a source for every sentence.
- **Call tracker** (shipped 2026-09-24 in the [catfolio fork](https://github.com/jackyyangjq/catfolio); upstream [PR #7](https://github.com/irrwood/catfolio/pull/7)): imports `data/calls.jsonl` and scores every call against the price moves that followed, with a hit rate and a follow-every-call curve per blogger.
